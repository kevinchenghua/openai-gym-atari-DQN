# openai-gym-atari-DQN
This is an implementation of deep Q-network (DQN) to play the atari games in [openai gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs#atari) (without RAM).

The algorithm is described in ["Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf). This package is a Theano-based implementation of the algorithm.
## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* [Theano (bettet to use GPU)](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#install)
* [gym[atari]](https://github.com/openai/gym)

## Usage
```
python test.py
```

## Result
